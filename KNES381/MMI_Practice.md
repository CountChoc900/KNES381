# Central Africa Scenario: #

*Answers:*
I see someone in power, has a rifle, physically assaulting what I assume to be 
a civilain

without knowing culture, local politics, etc cannot say exactly what is going on

immediate reaction based on photo is some kind of police brutality, but missing
context

maybe try to record. is there a crowd? what's the vibe?

*Feedback*
When asked what else you'd like to know, don't ask for more context (already mentioned)
give an example of specific context or information I'd want to know

Be more succinct. Give concrete answer and then nuance.


# Feedback for Gaby #
## Election $100 fine ##

Are you a representative of the Association? Do you speak for everyone or yourself?

Good to mention right not to vote, and what are implications of forcing people to vote?

$100 may be significant penalty, people voting solely to avoid penalty. 
Valuing democracy means valuing not voting

general principles: freedom of speech, freedom of expression (good). 
What about people's autonomy?

Great answer on balancing indiviual or society. People do not have full 
autonomy/no social responsibility. It's balanced

single payer promotes need of all, with greater resources going to those who 
require it (great!). But, medical ethics focuses on rights of the individual

## Physician car accident victim to hospital, are they liable for quadriplegia? ##

Acting in best interest of patient (good)

legally, might be protected if acting as a good samaritan or within medical training

Did physician act properly? did they call 911, could they have supported patient
on-scene vs driving to hospital

car insurance another issue.

Is there video of physician helping patient to determine if appropriate?

- is patient conscious
- extent of good samaritan protections
- did they act within scope

Depends on who sent it to me. Do I trust them?

plagiarism
Is it a good grade?
